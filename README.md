# Home-Builder-Buddy

## Description

We wanted to create an application to make building a home easier. As a home builder you are able to keep track of your current progess throuhgout the home building process. As a home builder you are presented with the current date and slider bars for each task associated with the home building process. You are aslo able to see your current location presented on a map as well as search for any location. This will make shipping supplies to the current project location easier. This application also features a custom google search bar so you are able to search for contractors or anything that would be needed. This application features MapBox api as well as a google custom search api. We learned how to work together to achieve a functioning, responsive and interactive website as well as work with new third party api's and new CSS framework.
